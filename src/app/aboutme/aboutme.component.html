      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        As a german-speaking front-end developer, I have initial project
        experience in building web applications with JavaScript, Typescript and
        Angular.

      <p>
        My interest in programming arose from my enthusiasm for reprogramming
        applications. As a result, I decided to pursue further training in the
        IT sector.

      <p>
        In the last few months I have been able to implement various projects
        independently and together in small agile teams. My portfolio includes
        some of my projects that highlight my programming skills.
