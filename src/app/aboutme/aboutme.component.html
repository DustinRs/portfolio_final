      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        I am a german-speaking frontend developer and have experience in
        JavaScript, Typescript and Angular. My interest in programming started in
        my free time through my enthusiasm for reprogramming applications.

      <p>
        As a result, I decided to complete a practice-oriented and TÃœV-certified
        further education at the Developer Academy and thus make a lateral entry
        into the IT world.

      <p>
        There I worked on various projects, gained experience with web
        development, worked with various technologies and worked together in
        groups using the SCRUM method.
